## Issues
Please raise issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/RalfKoban/ts-semantic-external-parser/issues).
If you can repeat the issue then please provide a sample to make it easier for me to also repeat it and then implement a fix.

Please do not hijack unrelated issues, I would rather you create a new issue than add noise to an unrelated issue.
